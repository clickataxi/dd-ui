# dd-ui - [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) directives that we use every day

***

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clickataxi/dd-ui.png)](http://travis-ci.org/clickataxi/dd-ui)

## Demo

Do you want to see directives in action? Visit http://clickataxi.github.io/dd-ui/!

## Installation
If you use jspm run `jspm install dd-ui=github:clickataxi/dd-ui`


```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['dd.ui']);
```
## Release
* Bump up version and <b>jspm main file number</b> in `package.json`
* Run cmd `grunt shell`

## Supported browsers

Directives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:
* Chrome (stable and canary channel)
* Firefox
* IE 9 and 10
* Opera
* Safari

Modern mobile browsers should work without problems.


We believe that most of the directives would work OK after:
* including relevant shims (for ES5 we recommend https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim)
* taking care of the steps described in http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie

## Project philosophy

### Native, lightweight directives

TODO:
The goal is to provide **native AngularJS directives** without any dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript.
It is often better to rewrite an existing JavaScript code and create a new, pure AngularJS directive. Most of the time the resulting directive is smaller as compared to the original JavaScript code size and better integrated into the AngularJS ecosystem.

### Customizability

All the directives in this repository should have their markup externalized as templates (loaded via `templateUrl`). In practice it means that you can **customize directive's markup at will**. One could even imagine providing a non-standard version of the templates!

### Take what you need and not more

Each directive has its own AngularJS module without any dependencies on other modules or third-party JavaScript code. In practice it means that you can **just grab the code for the directives you need** and you are not obliged to drag the whole repository.

### Quality and stability

Directives should work. All the time and in all browsers. This is why all the directives have a comprehensive suite of unit tests. All the automated tests are executed on each checkin in several browsers: Chrome, ChromeCanary, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9.
In fact we are fortunate enough to **benefit from the same testing infrastructure as AngularJS**!

## Support

Project's issue on GitHub should be used discuss bugs and features.

### Development
#### Prepare your environment
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM (should come with)
* Install global dev dependencies: `npm install -g grunt-cli karma`
* Install local dev dependencies: `npm install` while current directory is dd-ui repo

#### Build
* Build the whole project: `grunt` - this will run `lint`, `test`, and `concat` targets
* To build modules, first run `grunt html2js` then `grunt build:module1:module2...:moduleN`

You can generate a custom build, containing only needed modules, from the project's homepage.
Alternatively you can run local Grunt build from the command line and list needed modules as shown below:

```javascript
grunt build:modal:tabs:alert:popover:dropdownToggle:buttons:progressbar
```

Check the Grunt build file for other tasks that are defined for this project.

#### TDD
* Run test: `grunt watch`

This will start Karma server and will continuously watch files in the project, executing tests upon every change.

#### Demo page
* Compile files, start http server and watch changes: `grunt server`
 
#### Test coverage
Add the `--coverage` option (e.g. `grunt test --coverage`, `grunt watch --coverage`) to see reports on the test coverage. These coverage reports are found in the coverage folder.

### Customize templates

As mentioned directives from this repository have all the markup externalized in templates. You might want to customize default
templates to match your desired look & feel, add new functionality etc.

The easiest way to override an individual template is to use the `<script>` directive:

```html
<script id="template/alert/alert.html" type="text/ng-template">
    <div class='alert' ng-class='type && "alert-" + type'>
        <button ng-show='closeable' type='button' class='close' ng-click='close()'>Close</button>
        <div ng-transclude></div>
    </div>
</script>
```

If you want to override more templates it makes sense to store them as individual files and feed the `$templateCache` from those partials.
For people using Grunt as the build tool it can be easily done using the `grunt-html2js` plugin. You can also configure your own template url.
Let's have a look:

Your own template url is `views/partials/ui-bootstrap-tpls/alert/alert.html`.

Add "html2js" task to your Gruntfile
```javascript
html2js: {
  options: {
    base: '.',
    module: 'ui-templates',
    rename: function (modulePath) {
      var moduleName = modulePath.replace('app/views/partials/dd-ui-tpls/', '').replace('.html', '');
      return 'template' + '/' + moduleName + '.html';
    }
  },
  main: {
    src: ['app/views/partials/dd-ui-tpls/**/*.html'],
    dest: '.tmp/ui-templates.js'
  }
}
```

Make sure to load your template.js file
`<script src="/ui-templates.js"></script>`

Inject the `ui-templates` module in your `app.js`
```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [
  'dd.ui',
  'ui-templates'
]);
```

Then it will work fine!
